Linux-BootCleanup version 0.02

This modulino was created to aid in the task of cleaning up old kernel files
from the /boot directory and updating the system bootloader menu entries
accordingly.  It is primarily useful as a program.  It can be invoked directly
as such, e.g.

    # ('perldoc -l' returns the path to the specified installed module)
    $ perl `perldoc -l Linux::BootCleanup` --help

As a program, it can help you archive old kernel files from /boot, perhaps to
reclaim space on the /boot partition.  Additionally, the corresponding
obsolete and distracting kernel options will be removed from your boot menu.
Care is taken to backup modified files and to preserve archived data.

As a module, Linux::BootCleanup provides a few possibly-useful functions for
working with release numbers, kernel files in the /boot directory, and
bootloader menus.
